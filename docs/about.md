# About Me

I'm Stefan Burghelea, a Software Engineer based in Portugal with over 4 years of experience building full-stack web applications and backend systems.

I specialize in Python, Django, TypeScript, and cloud infrastructure like AWS and Kubernetes. I've recently worked with generative AI and LLM integrations, particularly building AI chatbots and content automation tools.

## Current Focus

I'm currently open to:

- **Freelance  projects**
- **Remote contract roles**
- **Part-time or flexible work** related to:
  - AI Chatbots
  - LLM integrations
  - Custom backend/API systems
  - Full-stack development (React, Next.js, FastAPI, Django)

I enjoy building smart, useful web tools that combine strong backend logic with clean frontend interfaces. I'm especially interested in projects that use AI to automate tasks, enhance user experience, or improve data workflows.
